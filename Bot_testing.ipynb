        "\n",
        "I'm confused about Takeshi's motivations and why he slaughtered all those Wedge guys. Obviously, he has no particular allegiances. He seems mostly driven by his loyalty and, surprisingly enough, his emotional attachment to particular people he's working with at the time. In the first novel, he seemed to have a more high-level motivation that included dealing out some general form of justice and it wasn't totally personal, but in *Broken Angels* his actions seemed purely personal. That's fine. His overall story in the series seems to be about breaking through all the Envoy training stuff (intentionally or not) and becoming more 'human'. I like that. I just want to make sure that there wasn't a less personal, more strategic motivation in his actions on the beach. Carrera didn't come across as the Big Bad Guy that what's-her-name did in the first book. I'm not saying there should be anything else, just curious.\n",

I remember the protagonist lamenting the fact that he had not had a chance to shower after having sex with his lover, and wondering if his wife could smell this on him. After venturing outside, his wife committed suicide and shortly thereafter he was \"beamed up\" to an enormous biological starship, along with other survivors of the war. These survivors formed a community of sorts while exploring the ship. The characters never discover why they were picked up, nor who controls the ship.\n",
